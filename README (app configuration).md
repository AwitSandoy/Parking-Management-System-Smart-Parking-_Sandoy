# Smart Parking Management System — Full Setup Guide

---

## Software System Overview

The Smart Parking Management System is a JavaFX desktop application that lets a
parking facility manage its slots, customers, and reservations through a simple
login-gated interface, backed by a MySQL database over raw JDBC.

**Major features:**
- **Account system:** Customers can register and log in; Admin accounts are
  seeded directly in the database.
- **Role-based dashboards:** Admins land on a tabbed dashboard with full CRUD
  over parking slots and users, plus a read-only view of every transaction.
  Customers land on a simpler dashboard focused on booking and releasing slots.
- **Slot booking & release:** Customers can book any `Available` slot, which
  atomically marks it `Occupied` and creates a reservation with an entry time.
  Releasing a slot computes the total charge from elapsed time × the slot's
  hourly rate, and frees the slot again — both wrapped in a single JDBC
  transaction so the two tables can never fall out of sync.
- **Session management via Java Serialization:** described in detail below.
- **Security:** every SQL query uses `PreparedStatement` (no string
  concatenation, no SQL injection risk); passwords are hashed with SHA-256
  before being stored or compared, never kept as plain text.

---

## Session Management (Java Serialization)

User sessions are persisted to disk using Java's built-in serialization
mechanism, rather than relying only on an in-memory object passed between
screens.

**How it works:**

1. **`models/Session.java`** is a small `Serializable` class that holds the
   logged-in user's `userId`, `username`, `role`, and `loginTime`. It
   deliberately does **not** store the password (hashed or otherwise) — a
   session file only needs to identify who is logged in, not their
   credentials.
2. **`utils/SessionManager.java`** handles the full file lifecycle:
   - `createSession(User)` — serializes a new `Session` object to a file
     called `session.dat` (via `ObjectOutputStream`), called immediately
     after a successful login in `LoginRegisterController`.
   - `getActiveSession()` — deserializes `session.dat` back into a `Session`
     object (via `ObjectInputStream`). Both `AdminDashboardController` and
     `CustomerDashboardController` call this when they load, and compare the
     returned session's `userId` against the logged-in user, so the session
     file is actually **used to validate and maintain the session** while
     navigating between screens rather than just sitting on disk unused.
   - `destroySession()` — deletes `session.dat` from disk. Called when the
     user clicks **Logout** in either dashboard, and also on app startup
     (`Main.java`) as a safety net in case a previous run was closed
     abnormally without a clean logout.
3. **End-to-end lifecycle:** log in → `session.dat` appears in the project's
   working directory → the file is read and validated as you navigate the
   dashboards → click Logout → `session.dat` is deleted and you're returned
   to the login screen.

## SOLID Principles Applied

Two SOLID design principles are deliberately applied in this project's
structure:

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Classes involved:** every class in `dao/` (`UserDAO`, `ParkingSlotDAO`,
`ReservationDAO`), every class in `controllers/` (`LoginRegisterController`,
`AdminDashboardController`, `CustomerDashboardController`), and every class
in `models/` (`User`, `ParkingSlot`, `Reservation`, `Session`).

**How it's applied:** `dao/` classes have exactly one job — talking to the
MySQL database via JDBC. `controllers/` classes have exactly one job —
handling UI events and updating what's on screen. `models/` classes have
exactly one job — holding data, with no business logic or database code
inside them at all.

**Benefit gained:** a change to a SQL query never requires touching a
controller or an FXML file, and a change to the UI layout never requires
touching database code. Each class has a single reason to change, which
makes the codebase far easier to navigate, test, and modify safely.

### 2. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Classes involved:** the interfaces `IUserDAO`, `IParkingSlotDAO`, and
`IReservationDAO` (in `dao/`), implemented by `UserDAO`, `ParkingSlotDAO`,
and `ReservationDAO` respectively; and the three controller classes
(`LoginRegisterController`, `AdminDashboardController`,
`CustomerDashboardController`) that depend on them.

**How it's applied:** rather than declaring DAO fields as concrete classes,
every controller depends on the interface type instead:
```java
private final IUserDAO userDAO = new UserDAO();
```
The controller only knows "something that fulfills the `IUserDAO` contract"
exists — it has no dependency on `UserDAO` specifically, only on the point
where it's constructed.

**Benefit gained:** the concrete DAO implementation can be swapped out
(for example, a mock implementation for unit testing, or a different data
source entirely) without changing a single line of controller code, since
the controller was never coupled to the concrete class in the first place.

---

## Design Patterns Applied

Three design patterns are deliberately implemented in this project, one from
each required category (Creational, Structural, Behavioral).

### 1. Singleton (Creational)

**Class involved:** `utils/DatabaseConnection.java`

**How it's applied:** the class has a private constructor, so it can never
be instantiated with `new DatabaseConnection()` from outside the class.
The only way to obtain it is through the static `getInstance()` method,
which lazily creates the single instance on first call and returns that
same instance on every call after that:
```java
public static synchronized DatabaseConnection getInstance() {
    if (instance == null) {
        instance = new DatabaseConnection();
    }
    return instance;
}
```
A convenience static method, `getConnection()`, is kept so existing DAO
code continues to work unchanged — internally it simply routes through
`getInstance()`.

**Benefit gained:** there is exactly one object in the application
responsible for knowing the database's URL and credentials and producing
connections from them, instead of that configuration being duplicated or
re-created in multiple places.

### 2. Facade (Structural)

**Class involved:** `dao/ParkingFacade.java`

**How it's applied:** `ParkingFacade` sits in front of two separate DAOs,
`IParkingSlotDAO` and `IReservationDAO`, and exposes a small, simplified
set of methods that match what a Customer actually wants to do:
`getAvailableSlots()`, `bookSlot()`, `releaseSlot()`, and
`getActiveReservationsForUser()`. `CustomerDashboardController` talks only
to this one Facade object instead of holding and coordinating two separate
DAOs itself.

**Benefit gained:** the coordination logic (e.g. notifying observers only
after a booking/release genuinely succeeds) lives in one place, and the
controller is simpler and has one fewer thing to know about.

### 3. Observer (Behavioral)

**Classes involved:** `utils/SlotStatusObserver.java` (the Observer
interface), `utils/SlotStatusPublisher.java` (the Subject/Publisher), and
`controllers/CustomerDashboardController.java` (a concrete Observer).

**How it's applied:** `ParkingFacade` owns a `SlotStatusPublisher` and
calls `notifyObservers()` on it immediately after a booking or release
succeeds. `CustomerDashboardController implements SlotStatusObserver` and
subscribes itself to that publisher in `initialize()`, so its
`onSlotStatusChanged()` method fires automatically and refreshes both
tables, without the booking/release button handlers needing to call
`refreshAll()` themselves.

**Benefit gained:** the code that performs a booking doesn't need to know
or care which screens are currently open and need refreshing — it just
announces that a change happened, and every subscribed observer reacts on
its own. Additional observers could be added later with no change to
`ParkingFacade` at all.

This is an **MVC layout**:
- **Model** → `models/` (plain data classes)
- **View** → `views/*.fxml` (Scene Builder–editable layouts)
- **Controller** → `controllers/` (UI logic, wired to FXML via `fx:controller`)
- `dao/` and `utils/` are the "persistence" layer the Controllers call into — this
  keeps SQL code completely out of your UI classes.

Default accounts seeded by `schema.sql`:

| Username | Password  | Role     |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| admin    | admin123  | Admin    |
| john     | john123   | Customer |

## Part A — Database & Server Setup (XAMPP & phpMyAdmin)

1. **Install XAMPP** (if not already installed) from https://www.apachefriends.org
   and complete the installer with default options.

2. **Open the XAMPP Control Panel.**
   - Click **Start** next to **Apache**.
   - Click **Start** next to **MySQL**.
   - You only need these two modules running (Apache serves phpMyAdmin's web
     pages; MySQL is the actual database server our Java app connects to).
   - Both rows should turn green and show a port number (Apache: 80/443,
     MySQL: 3306) once started.

3. **Open phpMyAdmin.**
   - In your browser, go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
   - You should see the phpMyAdmin home page (no login needed for the default
     XAMPP setup — it uses the `root` user with an empty password).

4. **Create the database and import the schema.**
   - Click the **SQL** tab at the top of phpMyAdmin (this lets you run a raw
     SQL script, no need to create the database by hand first).
   - Open the file `database/schema.sql` from this project in a text editor,
     copy its **entire contents**, and paste them into the SQL box in
     phpMyAdmin.
   - Click **Go**.
   - This single script will: create the `parking_system` database, create the
     three tables (`users`, `parking_slots`, `reservations`) with proper
     foreign keys, and insert default seed data (1 Admin, 1 Customer, 5
     parking slots).
   - Click on the `parking_system` database in the left sidebar and confirm
     you now see 3 tables, each with the expected rows.

> **Troubleshooting:** If MySQL fails to start in XAMPP (common on Windows if
> another MySQL instance or Skype is using port 3306), stop the conflicting
> service or change MySQL's port in XAMPP's `config` button, then update the
> `URL` constant in `DatabaseConnection.java` accordingly.

---

## Part B — Gathering the Dependencies

You need two things: the **JavaFX SDK** and the **MySQL Connector/J** JDBC driver.

### 1. JavaFX SDK
- Go to **https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/**
- Under "Downloads", choose:
  - **Version:** a recent LTS build (e.g. JavaFX 21.x) — match it to the JDK
    version you have installed if possible.
  - **Operating System:** yours (Windows / macOS / Linux)
  - **Architecture:** x64 (or aarch64 for Apple Silicon)
  - **Type:** **SDK** (NOT "jmods" — we want the plain SDK zip containing a
    `lib` folder full of `.jar` files)
- Download the `.zip`, then **extract it** somewhere permanent, e.g.:
  - Windows: `C:\Java\javafx-sdk-21.0.x`
  - macOS/Linux: `/opt/javafx-sdk-21.0.x` or `~/javafx-sdk-21.0.x`
- Inside that folder you should see a `lib` subfolder containing files like
  `javafx.controls.jar`, `javafx.fxml.jar`, `javafx.graphics.jar`, etc.
  **This `lib` folder is what you will point IntelliJ to.**

### 2. MySQL Connector/J (JDBC Driver)
- Go to **https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/**
- Under "Select Operating System", choose **"Platform Independent"**.
- Download the **ZIP Archive** (not the `.deb`/`.rpm`/`.msi` installers).
- Extract it. Inside you'll find a file like `mysql-connector-j-8.x.x.jar`.
  **Remember this file's location** — you'll add it as a library too.

---

## Part C — Project Setup in IntelliJ IDEA

### 1. Create a new plain Java project
- Open IntelliJ IDEA → **New Project**.
- Select **Java** on the left (make sure **no** build system like Maven or
  Gradle is selected — IntelliJ's "New Project" wizard has a "Build system"
  dropdown; set it to **IntelliJ**, which creates a classic project with no
  extra config files).
- Name the project `SmartParkingSystem`, choose a location, pick your
  installed JDK (Java 17+ recommended), and click **Create**.

### 2. Recreate the folder/package structure
- In IntelliJ, right-click the `src` folder → **Mark Directory as** →
  **Sources Root** (it may already be marked; the icon turns blue when it is).
- Under `src`, create these **packages** (right-click `src` → **New** →
  **Package**, then type the name):
  - `application`
  - `controllers`
  - `models`
  - `dao`
  - `utils`
- Under `src`, also create a plain **Directory** (not a package) named
  `views` (right-click `src` → **New** → **Directory** → type `views`).
  FXML files are not Java classes, so this stays a directory, not a package.
- Copy each `.java` file from this project's matching folder into the
  matching IntelliJ package, and copy the three `.fxml` files into the
  `views` directory. (Simplest approach: copy the whole `src` folder's
  contents from this project directly into your new IntelliJ project's `src`
  folder using your OS file explorer, then refresh IntelliJ's project view.)
- Your Project tool window should now mirror the **Project Structure
  Overview** shown at the top of this guide.

### 3. Add the JavaFX and MySQL JARs as Libraries
- Go to **File → Project Structure** (or press `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S` /
  `Cmd+;` on macOS).
- Select **Libraries** in the left list under "Project Settings".
- Click the **+** (plus) button → **Java**.
- Navigate to your extracted JavaFX SDK folder → open the **`lib`** folder →
  select **all the `.jar` files inside it** (Ctrl/Cmd-click or Ctrl+A) →
  click **OK**.
- When prompted "Add library to module", select your `SmartParkingSystem`
  module and click **OK**. You should now see a new library (e.g.
  `javafx-sdk-21.0.x`) listed, attached to your module.
- Click **+** again → **Java** → navigate to and select the
  `mysql-connector-j-8.x.x.jar` file you downloaded earlier → **OK** → attach
  it to your module the same way.
- Click **Apply**, then **OK** to close Project Structure.

At this point, your project should compile with zero red underlines on the
`import javafx.*` and `import java.sql.*` / MySQL-related lines.

---

## Part D — Configuring and Running the App

JavaFX is no longer bundled with the JDK, and since we're not using a build
tool, IntelliJ needs to be told explicitly how to launch the JavaFX runtime
via VM options.

### 1. Create a Run/Debug Configuration
- Open `Main.java` (in `application` package).
- Right-click inside the editor → **Modify Run Configuration...**
  (or click the dropdown near the Run button at the top → **Edit
  Configurations...** → click **+** → **Application**).
- Set:
  - **Name:** `Main`
  - **Main class:** `application.Main`
  - **Use classpath of module:** `SmartParkingSystem`

### 2. Add the required VM options
- In the same configuration dialog, find the **VM options** field (if it's
  not visible, click **Modify options** → check **Add VM options**).
- Paste the following, **replacing the path with your actual JavaFX `lib`
  folder path**:

  **Windows example:**
  ```
  --module-path "C:\Java\javafx-sdk-21.0.x\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
  ```

  **macOS/Linux example:**
  ```
  --module-path "/opt/javafx-sdk-21.0.x/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
  ```

- Click **Apply** → **OK**.

### 3. Verify your database credentials
- Open `src/utils/DatabaseConnection.java`.
- Confirm the constants match your XAMPP MySQL setup:
  ```java
  private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/parking_system?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC";
  private static final String USER = "root";
  private static final String PASSWORD = ""; // default XAMPP password is empty
  ```
- If you ever set a root password in MySQL/phpMyAdmin, update `PASSWORD` here
  to match.

### 4. Run it
- Make sure **Apache** and **MySQL** are still running in the XAMPP Control
  Panel.
- Click the green **Run** ▶ button in IntelliJ (or `Shift+F10`).
- The Login/Register window should appear.
- Log in with the seeded Admin account (`admin` / `admin123`) to see the
  Admin Dashboard, or the Customer account (`john` / `john123`) to see the
  Customer Dashboard — or register a brand-new Customer account from the
  login screen.

### Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Error: JavaFX runtime components are missing` | Your VM options weren't applied to the Run Configuration you're actually running — double-check Part D, Step 2. |
| `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.exceptions.CommunicationsException` / connection refused | MySQL isn't running in XAMPP, or the port/URL is wrong. |
| `Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'` | Your MySQL root password isn't empty — update `PASSWORD` in `DatabaseConnection.java`. |
| `Unknown database 'parking_system'` | You didn't run `schema.sql` in phpMyAdmin yet, or ran it against the wrong server. |
| `ClassNotFoundException: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver` | The MySQL Connector/J jar wasn't attached as a library to your module — redo Part C, Step 3. |
| FXML fails to load / `Location is not set` | The `views` folder wasn't marked correctly, or `src` isn't the Sources Root — confirm Part C, Step 2. |

## How the Security & Architecture Pieces Fit Together

- **SQL Injection prevention:** every single query in `dao/` uses
  `PreparedStatement` with `?` placeholders — user input is never concatenated
  into SQL strings.
- **Password safety:** passwords are hashed with SHA-256 (`PasswordUtil`)
  before being stored or compared; plain-text passwords never touch the
  database.
- **Connection safety:** `DatabaseConnection.getConnection()` returns a fresh
  connection every time, always used inside `try-with-resources`, so
  connections are never leaked even if an exception occurs mid-query.
- **Transactional integrity:** booking and releasing a slot
  (`ReservationDAO`) wrap the reservation + slot-status updates in a single
  JDBC transaction (`setAutoCommit(false)` + `commit()`/`rollback()`), so the
  two tables can never drift out of sync.
- **Role-based access:** `LoginRegisterController` routes Admins to
  `AdminDashboard.fxml` and Customers to `CustomerDashboard.fxml` after
  checking `User.getRole()` — Customers never even load the Admin screen's
  FXML or controller.
